# üß† Diabetes Prediction using SVM

## üìå Project Overview

This project involves predicting the likelihood of diabetes using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. The dataset was sourced from Kaggle, and the full machine learning pipeline was implemented in Google Colab.

## üîß Steps Performed

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Dataset

* Used `diabetes_prediction_dataset.csv` from Kaggle
* Target column: `diabetes` (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
* Uploaded to GitHub and loaded via raw link

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Preprocessing

* One-hot encoded categorical features (`gender`, `smoking_history`)
* Split into train/test sets using an 80/20 ratio
* Applied feature scaling using `StandardScaler` (important for SVM)

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Model Training

* Trained `SVC()` model from `sklearn.svm`
* Evaluation metrics:

  * Accuracy
  * Precision
  * Recall
  * F1-score
  * Specificity
  * Confusion matrix

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Hyperparameter Tuning

* Used `GridSearchCV` with 5-fold cross-validation
* Tuned parameters:

  * `C` (regularization strength)
  * `gamma` (kernel coefficient)
  * `kernel` (`rbf`, `linear`)
* Re-evaluated the model using the best estimator

## ‚úÖ Final Evaluation

The tuned SVM model performed well and effectively handled class imbalance. **Specificity** was particularly useful for accurately detecting non-diabetic cases.
